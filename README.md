# Hello Database!

Because `hello_world` is so 1974 and `hello_todo` is so 2015.

### What is this?

I figured the best way to learn a new language would be to implement a
SQL database.

Also that it would be the best way to learn how to implement a SQL database.

I'd originally started this in Rust, but have since been more excited to learn
Julia.

### Why a database?

A database involves understanding IO (read/write to/from disk), memory
management, networking (server/client), string parsing (implement SQL
interpreter), testing (you must test your database fool!), and organizing a
large codebase.

So it's a pretty decent way to master a new language in one go.

### Have you ever written a database before?

No. I am mostly following the design of the database described
in the book *Database Design and Implementation*, which includes sample code in
Java.

### Are you actually gonna build a complete SQL database in Julia?
