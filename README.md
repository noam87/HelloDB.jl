# Hello Database!

Because `hello_world` is so 1974, and `hello_todo` is so 2015.

**WORK IN PROGRESS - WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE IT**

### What is this?

I originally started this project in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I figured the best way to learn a new language would be to implement a SQL
database. Also that it would be the best way to learn how to implement a SQL
database.

This repo's in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) which is both one of the most
powerful dynamic languags out there right now, and a joy to work in!

This is mostly an educational exercise for myself, but I will try to make the
code as readable as I can and include lots of explanatory comments, both
for the betterment of futureme and others.

### Why a database?

A database involves understanding IO (read/write to/from disk), memory
management, networking (server/client), string parsing (implement SQL
interpreter), testing (you must test your database fool!), and organizing a
large codebase.

So it's a pretty decent way to master a new language in one go.

### Have you ever written a database before?

No. I am mostly following the design of the database described
in the book *Database Design and Implementation*, which includes sample code in
Java.

### Are you actually gonna build a complete SQL database in Julia?

### Should I use HelloDB to launch my next big-data web-scale billion dollar startup?

Yes.
